Types of Attack,Explanation,Example,Corresponding TTP (MITRE ATT&CK)
Buffer Overflow,Attacks the bufferâ€™s boundaries and overwrites memory area.,"Long URL strings are a common input. Cowan, et al. (1998)","Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203), Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068)"
Worm,Reproduces itself on the local host or through the network.,"SQL Slammer, Mydoom, CodeRed Nimda.","Replication Through Removable Media (T1091), Automated Exfiltration (T1020)"
Trojan,"Programs appear attractive and genuine, but have malicious code embedded inside them.","Zeus, SpyEye Alazab, et al. (2013)","User Execution (T1204), Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105)"
Denial of Service (DoS),A security event to disrupt the network services. It is started by forcing reset on the target computers. The users can no longer connect to the system because of unavailability of service.,"Buffer overflow, Ping of death (PoD), TCP SYN, smurf, teardrop Zargar, et al. (2013)",Network Denial of Service (T1498)
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Scripts,The attacker takes advantage of CGI scripts to create an attack by sending illegitimate inputs to the web server.,Phishing email; Aljawarneh (2016),"Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210), Valid Accounts (T1078)"
Traffic Flooding,"Attacks the limited size of NIDS to handle huge traffic loads and to investigate for possible intrusions. If a cybercriminal can cause congestion in the networks, then NIDS will be busy in analyzing the traffic.","Denial of Service (Dos) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Zargar, et al. (2013)",Network Denial of Service (T1498)
Physical Attack,Aims to attack the physical mechanisms of the computer system.,"Cold boot, evil maid (Pasqualetti et al., 2013)","Data Destruction (T1485), Disk Wipe (T1561.001)"
Password Attack,"Aims to break the password within a small time, and is noticed by a sequence of failures login.","A dictionary attack, Rainbow attack (Das et al., 2014)","Brute Force (T1110), Credential Dumping (T1003)"
Information Gathering,Gathers information or finds weaknesses in computers or networks by sniffing or searching.,"System scan, port scan, (Bou-Harb et al., 2014)","Network Service Scanning (T1046), System Information Discovery (T1082)"
User to Root (U2R) attack,The cybercriminal accesses as a normal user in the beginning and then upgrades to a super-user which may lead to exploitation of several vulnerabilities of the system.,"Intercept packets, rainbow attack, social engineering Rootkit, load module, (Perl Raiyn, 2014)","Privilege Escalation (T1068), Valid Accounts (T1078)"
Remote to Local (R2L) attack,The cybercriminal sends packets to a remote system by connecting to the network without having an account on the system.,"Warezclient, ftp write, multihop,phf, spy, warezmaster,imap (Raiyn, 2014)","Remote Access Tools (T1219), Valid Accounts (T1078)"
Probe,Identifying the valid IP addresses by scanning the network to gather host data packets.,"Sweep, portsweep (So-In et al., 2014)","Network Service Scanning (T1046), System Network Configuration Discovery (T1016)"
