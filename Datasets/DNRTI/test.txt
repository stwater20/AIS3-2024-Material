insight O

the O

(TTPs) O
of O
a O
Brazilian O
cyber O
crime B-HackOrg
group I-HackOrg
that O
specializes O
in O
payment B-Purp

operations O
. O

The O
threat O
actors B-HackOrg
, O
observed O
by O
FireEye B-SecTeam
Labs I-SecTeam
, O
use O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
methods O
to O
either O
compromise O
or O
acquire O
already O

, O
including O
sharing O

online O
, O
hacking O
vulnerable O
merchant O
websites O

compromising B-Way
payment I-Way
card I-Way
processing O
devices O
. O

Once O
in O
their O
possession O
, O
the O
actors B-HackOrg
use O
these O
compromised O
payment O
card O

to O
generate B-Purp
further I-Purp
card I-Purp
information I-Purp

The O
members O

a O

of O

CCleaner B-Tool

on O
a O
daily O
basis O
to O
effectively O
remove B-Purp
any I-Purp

Another O
common O
step O
taken O
by O
threat O
actors B-HackOrg
is O
changing B-Way
their I-Way
system's I-Way

being O
uniquely O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
these O
actors B-HackOrg
often O
use O
tools O
such O
as O
Technitium B-Tool

We O
have O

We O

that O
use O

obfuscate B-Purp

. O

Based O
on O

, O
this O

Once O
