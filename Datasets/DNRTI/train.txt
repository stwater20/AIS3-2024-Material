their O

The O
Dukes B-HackOrg
actively O
targeted O
Ukraine B-Area
before O
the O

, O
at O
a O
time O
when O

was O
no O

, O
the O

also O

developed O
an O

during O
the O
spring B-Time

The O
Dukes B-HackOrg
could O
have O

summer B-Time

, O
again O
the O

clearly O
prioritized O
the O
continuation O
of O

operations O
over O
maintaining O

continued O

more O

surgical O
campaigns B-OffAct
using O

We O

the O
exploitation O

where O
we O

the O

a O
zero-day B-Exp
at O
the O
time O

All O
of O
the O

does O
in O

entities I-Org
since O
at O

surmise O

the O

APT38 B-HackOrg
also O

A O
second O

confident O
this O

Utilizing O

the O

most O

served O
one O
of O
two O

the O

Today O
we'd O
like O

some O

something O
new O

what O

currently O
common O

when O

have O
been O
just O
a O
few O

However O
, O
from O
this O
it O
's O
only O
clear O
that O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
might O
have O
attacked O
Polish O

Symantec B-SecTeam
also O
confirmed O

Considering O
that O
the O
afterhack O
publications O

mentioned O
that O
the O
investigation O
stumbled O
upon O
three O
different O
attackers B-HackOrg
, O
it O
was O
not O
obvious O
whether O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
was O
the O
one O
responsible O
for O
the O
fraudulent O
SWIFT O
transactions O
, O
or O
if O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
had O
in O
fact O
developed O
its O
own O
malware O
to O
attack O
banks B-Idus
' O
systems O
. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
add O
some O
strong O
facts O
that O
link O
some O
attacks B-OffAct
on O
banks B-Idus
to O
Lazarus B-HackOrg
, O
and O
share O
some O
of O
our O
own O
findings O
as O
well O
as O
shed O
some O
light O
on O
the O
recent O
TTPs O
used O
by O
the O

Lazarus B-OffAct
attacks I-OffAct
are O
not O
a O
local O
problem O
and O
clearly O
the O
group B-HackOrg
's O
operations O
span O
across O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

Lazarus B-HackOrg
was O
previously O
known O
to O
conduct O
cyberespionage B-OffAct

cybersabotage I-OffAct

We O
believe O
that O
Lazarus B-HackOrg

is O
very O
large O

works O
mainly O
on O
infiltration O

a O
substantially O
smaller O
units O
within O
the O

we O
have O
dubbed O
Bluenoroff B-HackOrg

is O
responsible O
for O
financial O
profit O
. O

Lazarus B-HackOrg
regrouped O
and O
rushed O
into O
new O
countries O
, O
selecting O
mostly O
poorer O
and O
less O
developed O
locations O
, O
hitting O
smaller O

because O
they O
are O
, O
apparently O
, O
easy O
prey O
. O

To O
date O
, O
the O
Lazarus B-HackOrg

against O
the O

We O
believe O
that O

remain O
one O

the O

threats O

from O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
similarities O
to O
previous O
Turla B-OffAct
campaigns I-OffAct
, O
we O
believe O
that O
WhiteBear B-Tool
is O
a O
distinct O
project O
with O
a O
separate O
focus O
. O

From O
February B-Time
to O
September B-Time
2016 I-Time
, O
WhiteBear B-OffAct
activity I-OffAct
was O
narrowly O
focused O
on O
embassies B-Org
and O
consular O
operations O
around O
the O
world O
. O

Continued O
WhiteBear B-OffAct
activity I-OffAct
later O
shifted O
to O
include O
defense-related B-Org
organizations I-Org
into O
June B-Time
2017 I-Time
. O

All O
of O
these O
early O
WhiteBear B-Tool
targets O
were O
related O
to O
embassies B-Org
and O
diplomatic/foreign O
affair O
organizations O
. O

Thus O
, O
Turla B-HackOrg
operators O
had O
access O
to O
some O
highly O
sensitive O
information O
( O
such O

emails B-Way

by O
the O
German B-Org

) O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
. O

Our O
investigation O
also O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
dozens O

email O

registered O
by O
Turla O
operators O

used O

receive O
exfiltrated O

Turla B-HackOrg
steals O
emails B-Way
by O
forwarding O
all O
outgoing O
emails B-Way
to O
the O

. O

We O
identified O
several O
European B-Idus
governments I-Idus
and O
defense B-Org
companies I-Org
compromised O
with O
this O
group O
. O

What O
actually O
happens O
is O
that O
the O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
decode O
data O
from O
the O
PDF B-Tool
documents I-Tool
and O
interpret O
it O
as O
commands O
for O
the O
backdoor O
. O

In O
early O
2018 B-Time
, O
multiple O
media B-Idus
claimed O
that O
Turla O
operators O
used O

to O
control O

As O
detailed O
in O
the O

, O
this O
malware O
is O
able O
to O
manipulate B-Features

exfiltrate I-Features

. O

To O
our O
knowledge O
, O
Turla O
is O
the O
only O
espionage O
group O
that O
currently O
uses O
a O
backdoor O
entirely O
controlled O
by O

more O
specifically O

Our O
research O
shows O
that O

are O
at O
risk O
of O
not O
only O
being O
spied O
on O
by O
the O

The O

We O
suspect O
the O

be O
linked O

and O
which O
can O
work O
independently O
of O
any O

A O

of O
Turla O
operations O
is O
iterations O
of O
their O

can O
be O

If O
the O
hypothesis O

correct O
and O
the O
Turla B-HackOrg
threat O
group O
is O
using O
Kazuar B-Tool
, O
we O
believe O
they O
may O
be O
using O
it O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O

The O
subject O
is O
a O
series O
of O
targeted B-OffAct
attacks I-OffAct
against O
private B-Org
companies I-Org

e O

Also O
, O
by O
creating O

According O

this O

Our O
initial O
observation O
of O
the O

originated O
from O
in-the-wild O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O

is O
that O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut O
appears O
to O
track O

more I-Purp

Bahamut O
spearphishing B-Way
attempts O
have O
also O
been O
accompanied O
with O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-HackOrg

their O

were O
only O
detected O
in O
August B-Time
2015 I-Time

At O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
group O
is O
known O
to O
target O
Russian O
and O
Ukrainian B-Area
banks B-Idus
. O

Buhtrap B-HackOrg
is O
the O
first O
hacker O
group O
using O
a O
network B-Way
worm I-Way
to O
infect O
the O
overall O

significantly O
increases O

( O
further O
referred O

If O

, O
then O
the O

contained O
instructions O

We O
noticed O
that O
criminals O
were O
spreading O
Buhtrap B-HackOrg
using O
this O
method O
from O
May B-Time
2015 I-Time
to O
August B-Time
2015 I-Time
. O

It O
is O
worth O
noting O
that O
attackers O
used O
the O
same O
compromised B-Tool
websites I-Tool
to O
spread O
Buhtrap B-Tool
as O
those O
that O
had O
been O
used O
for O
the O
Corkow B-Tool
Trojan I-Tool
. O

Moreover O
, O
they O
used O
the O
same O
exploit O
kit B-Exp
Niteris I-Exp
as O
that O
in O
the O
Corkow B-Tool
case O
. O

Purportedly O
during O
one O
of O
the O
first O
attacks B-OffAct
hackers O
intercepted O
the O
mailing O
list O
of O
the O
Anti-drop O
" O
club O
and O
created O
a O
specific O
phishing B-Way
email I-Way
for O
its O
members O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
still O
widely O
used O
, O
notably O
in O
Russia B-Area
. O

As O
noted O
in O
our O
previous O
blog O
on O
Buhtrap O
, O
this O
gang O
has O
been O
actively O
targeting O
Russian O
businesses B-Idus
, O
mostly O
through O
spear-phishing B-Way
. O

It O
is O
thus O
interesting O
to O
see O
Buhtrap O
add O
strategic B-Way
web I-Way
compromises I-Way
to O
their O
arsenal O
. O

The O
first O
malware O
we O
saw O
was O
the O
lurk B-Tool
downloader I-Tool
, O
which O
was O
distributed O
on O
October B-Time
26th I-Time
. O

The O
executable O
would O
install O
the O
real O
Ammyy O
product O
, O
but O
would O
also O
launch O
a O
file O
called O
either O
AmmyyService.exe B-SamFile
or O
AmmyySvc.exe B-SamFile
which O
contained O
the O
malicious O
payload O
. O

Buhtrap B-HackOrg
is O
getting O
better O
at O
disguising O
the O
code O
they O
inject O
into O
compromised B-Tool
websites I-Tool
. O

With O
the O
recent O
arrests O
of O
actors O
using O
the O
Lurk B-Tool
banking I-Tool
trojan I-Tool
, O
Buhtrap O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
likely O
alternative O
for O
actors O
wishing O
to O
target O
Russian B-Area
banks B-Idus
and O
software O
. O

They O
have O
different O
functions O
and O
ways O
of O
spreading O
, O
but O
the O
same O
purpose O
— O
to O
steal B-Purp
money I-Purp
from O
the O
accounts O
of O
businesses B-Idus
. O

Our O
experts O
have O
found O
that O
cybercriminals O
are O
actively O
focusing O
on O
SMBs B-Tool
, O
and O
giving O
particular O
attention O
to O
accountants B-Org
. O

The O
first O
encounter O
with O
Buhtrap O
was O
registered O
back O
in O
2014 B-Time
. O

For O
now O
, O
we O
can O
call O
RTM B-Tool
one O
of O
the O
most O
active O
financial B-Idus
Trojans O
. O

At O
that O
time O
it O
was O
the O
name O
of O
a O
cybercriminal O
group O
that O
was O
stealing B-Purp
money I-Purp
from O
Russian B-Area
financial B-Org
establishments I-Org
— O
to O
the O
tune O
of O
at O
least O
$150,000 O
per O
hit O
. O

Buhtrap O
resurfaced O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
2017 B-Time
in O
the O
TwoBee B-OffAct
campaign I-OffAct
, O
where O
it O
served O
primarily O
as O
means O
of O
malware O
delivery O
. O

After O
the O
source O
codes O
of O
their O
tools O
became O
public O
in O
2016 B-Time
, O
the O
name O
Buhtrap O
was O
used O
for O
the O
financial B-Tool
Trojan I-Tool
. O

Just O
like O
last O
time O
, O
Buhtrap O
is O
spreading O
through O
exploits O
embedded O
in O
news B-Idus
outlets I-Idus
. O

Estimating O
the O
damages O
is O
challenging O
, O
but O
as O
we O
learned O
, O
the O
criminals O
are O
siphoning B-Purp
off I-Purp
assets I-Purp
in I-Purp
transactions I-Purp
that O
do O
not O
exceed O
$15,000 O
each O
. O

As O
explained O
later O
, O
we O
believe O
this O
campaign B-OffAct
is O
financially-motivated O
and O
that O
it O
targets O
accounting B-Org
departments I-Org
in O
Russian O
businesses B-Idus
. O

" O
Buhgalter O
" O
means O
" O
accountant O
" O
in O
Russian B-Area
. O

Seeing O
a O
campaign B-OffAct
like O
this O
, O
inevitably O
the O
Anunak/Carbanak B-Tool
documented O
by O
Fox-IT B-SecTeam
and O
Kaspersky B-SecTeam
comes O
to O
mind O
. O

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
similar O
, O
it O
uses O
a O
similar O
modified O
mimikatz B-Tool

, O
and O
it O
uses O
a O
third-party B-Tool

, O
changes O

latest O
attack B-OffAct

industrial O

point O
that O

In O

we O
discovered O
Silence B-OffAct
attack I-OffAct
on O
financial B-Org

The O
infection O
vector O
is O
a O
spear-phishing B-Way

with O
a O
malicious O
attachment O
. O

An O
interesting O
point O
in O
the O
Silence B-OffAct

is O
that O
the O
cybercriminals O
had O
already O
compromised O

to O
send O

the O
most O

We O
conclude O
that O
the O
actor O
behind O
the O

is O
Silence O

, O
a O
relatively O

used O
DNS B-Features
hijacking I-Features

the O

this O

tactics O
when O
it O
publicly O
revealed O
its O

a O
consequence O
of O
the O
compromise O

. O

During O
a O
typical O
incident O
, O
the O
actor B-HackOrg
would O
modify O
the O
NS O

The O
next O
step O
for O
the O
actor B-HackOrg
was O
to O
build O
MitM B-Tool

by O
the O
actor B-HackOrg
during O
the O
observed O

The O
attackers B-HackOrg
would O
then O
use O
the O

perform O
additional O

these O
actor-controlled B-HackOrg

displaying O
the O
stolen O

One O
notable O
aspect O
of O
the O
campaign O
was O
the O
actors' B-HackOrg
ability O

impersonate O

At O
this O
time O

we B-SecTeam

not O
believe O
that O

found O

Rather O
, O

it O
is O

We O
suggest O
that O
APT41 B-HackOrg
sought O

found O
they O
could O
not O
monetize O
the O

so O
the O

attempt O

salvage B-Purp

conducted O
simultaneous O

from O

, O
and O

some O
indication O
that O
the O
group O
also O
tracks O
individuals O
and O
conducts O
surveillance O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
group B-HackOrg
has O
repeatedly O
targeted O
call O
record O
information O
at O
telecom B-Org
companies B-Org
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
established O
and O
maintained O
strategic O
access O
to O
organizations O
in O
the O
healthcare B-Idus
, O
high-tech B-Idus
, O
and O
telecommunications B-Idus
sectors B-Idus
. O

The O
group’s O
financially O
motivated O
activity O
has O
primarily O
focused O
on O
the O
video B-Org
game I-Org
industry I-Org
, O
where O
APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
manipulated B-OffAct
virtual O
currencies O
and O
even O
attempted O
to O
deploy B-OffAct
ransomware B-OffAct
. O

In O
another O
instance O
, O
O
APT41 B-HackOrg
targeted O
a O
hotel’s O
reservation O
systems O
ahead O
of O
Chinese O
officials O
staying O
there O
, O
suggesting O
the O
group O
was O
tasked B-Purp
to O
reconnoiter O
the O
facility O
for O
security O
reasons O
. O

These O
supply B-Way
chain I-Way
compromise O
tactics O
have O
also O
been O
characteristic O
of O
APT41’s B-HackOrg
best O
known O
and O
most O
recent O
espionage O
campaigns O
. O

Interestingly O
, O
despite O
the O
significant O
effort O
required O
to O
execute O
supply O
chain O
compromises O
and O
the O
large O
number O
of O
affected O
organizations O
, O
APT41 B-HackOrg
limits B-Way
the O
deployment O
of O
follow-on O
malware O
to O
specific O
victim O
systems O
by O
matching B-Way
against O
individual O
system O
identifiers O
. O

Mapping O
the O
group’s O
activities O
since O
2012 O
(Figure O
2) O
also O
provides O
some O
indication O
that O
APT41 B-HackOrg
primarily O
conducts B-OffAct
financially O
motivated O
operations O
outside O
of O
their O
normal O
day O
jobs O
. O

The O
latter O
is O
especially O
notable O
because O
APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
repeatedly O
returned O
to O
targeting O
the O
video B-Idus
game I-Idus
industry I-Idus
and O
we O
believe O
these O
activities O
were O
formative O
in O
the O
group’s O
later O
espionage O
operations O
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
leverages O
an O
arsenal O
of O
over O
46 O
different O
malware B-Tool
families I-Tool
and O
tools B-Tool
to O
accomplish O
their O
missions O
, O
O
including O
publicly O
available O
utilities O
, O
malware O
shared O
with O
other O
Chinese O
espionage O
operations O
, O
and O
tools O
unique O
to O
the O
group B-HackOrg
. O

Once O
in O
a O
victim O
organization O
, O
APT41 B-HackOrg
can O
leverage B-OffAct
more O
sophisticated O
TTPs O
and O
deploy B-OffAct
additional I-OffAct
malware I-OffAct
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
often O
relies O
on O
spear-phishing B-Way
emails I-Way
with O
attachments O
such O
as O
compiled O
HTML O
(.chm) O
files O
to O
initially O
compromise O
their O
victims O
. O

APT41 B-HackOrg
has O
also O
deployed B-Way
rootkits I-Way
and O
Master O
Boot O
Record O
(MBR) O
bootkits O
on O
a O
limited O
basis O
to O
hide O
their O
malware O
and O
maintain O
persistence O
on O
select O
victim O
systems O
. O

The O
limited O
use O
of O
these O
tools O
by O
APT41 B-HackOrg
suggests O
the O
group O
reserves B-Purp
more I-Purp
advanced I-Purp
TTPs I-Purp
and O
malware O
only O
for O
high-value O
targets O
. O

Like O
other O
Chinese O
espionage O
operators O
, O
APT41 B-HackOrg
appears O
to O
have O
moved O
toward O
strategic O
intelligence O
collection O
and O
establishing O
access O
and O
away O
from O

since O

This O
shift O
, O
however O
, O
has O
not O
affected O
the O

interest O
in O

, O
Waterbug’s B-HackOrg

One O
of O

things O

that O
during O
an O
attack O
against O
one O
target O
in O
the O
Middle B-Area

, O
Waterbug B-HackOrg
appeared O
to O
hijack O
infrastructure O
from O
the O
Crambus O
espionage O
group B-HackOrg

used O
it O
to O
deliver O
malware O
on O

the O

network O
. O

These O
three O
recent O
Waterbug B-HackOrg

compromise B-Org
governments I-Org

Curiously O
though O
, O

also O
compromised O
other O

on O
the O
victim’s O

Symantec B-SecTeam
believes O
that O
the O
variant O
of O
Mimikatz B-Tool
used O
in O
this O

is O
unique O
to O
Waterbug B-HackOrg

Aside O
from O
the O
attack O
involving O

, O
this O
sample O

The O
first O

came O
on O
January B-Time

when O

In O

case O
of O
the O
attack O
against O
the O

Crambus B-HackOrg
was O
the O
first O

, O
with O
the O
earliest O
evidence O

activity O
dating O
to O
November B-Time
2017 I-Time
. O

Waterbug’s B-HackOrg
intrusions O
on O
the O

continued O
for O
much O

Symantec B-SecTeam

not O

its O
observed O
use O
of O
Crambus O

suggests O
that O
Waterbug B-HackOrg
may O
have O
used O
the O

an O
initial O

to O
avoid O

In O
one O

reported O

Rapid7 B-SecTeam
in O

At O
first O
glance O
CONFUCIUS_B B-SamFile
looks O
very O
similar O

they O
are O

We O
also O
believe O
that O
both O

therefore O
we O

many O
espionage B-OffAct
campaigns I-OffAct
, O
much O
of O
APT40 B-HackOrg

activity B-OffAct
begins O
by O
attempting O
to O
trick O

with O

, O
before O
deploying O

We O
suspect O
that O
the O

sought O
access O

these O

obtain O
information O
that O

although O
the O
quality O
of O

varied O

One O
curious O
trait O
of O
Bahamut O
is O
that O
it O
develops O
fully-functional O
applications O
in O
support B-Purp
of I-Purp
its I-Purp

activities I-Purp
, O
rather O
than O
push O
nonfunctional O
fake O
apps O
or O
bundle O

with O
legitimate B-Tool
software I-Tool
. O

Curiously O
, O
Bahamut O
appears O
to O
track O
password O
attempts O

or O
to O
provoke O
the O
target O

provide B-Purp
more I-Purp
passwords I-Purp
. O

Thus O
far O
, O
Bahamut B-HackOrg

appeared O
to O
be O
primarily B-Purp
